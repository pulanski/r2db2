# Database Metrics API Design

This API design is inspired by the Kubernetes Metrics Server and the RESTful API used by Firecracker MicroVMs. The goal is to provide a comprehensive and user-friendly interface for monitoring the health, performance, and usage statistics of the database system. The API itself is RESTful, enabling easy integration with various tools and applications. It offers a detailed view of the system's internals, enabling client-side applications to gain deeper insights.

## Overview

The Metrics API exposes several endpoints to retrieve different types of metrics and system information. The API follows REST principles and uses standard HTTP methods. JSON is used as the primary data exchange format.

## API Endpoints

  "active_connections": 25,
  "total_queries_executed": 1000,
  "query_response_time_avg": "50ms",
  // Additional metrics...
}
```

### 2. `/metrics/{metric_name}`

Retrieve a specific metric.

  // Additional configuration settings...
}
```

#### PUT `/config`

Updates the configuration settings.

**Request:**

```json
{
  "max_connections": 150,
  "logging_level": "DEBUG",
  // Other settings to update...
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "status": "Configuration updated successfully"
}
```

### 7. `/events`

Stream of real-time events happening in the database system.

#### GET `/events`

**Response:**

Stream of event data, such as query executions, login attempts, or errors.

### 8. `/backups`

Manage and monitor database backups.

#### GET `/backups`

Lists all the backups available.

**Response:**

```json
[
  {
    "backup_id": "backup_123",
    "created_at": "2021-01-01T12:00:00Z",
    "size": "500MB"
  },
  // Additional backups...
]
```

#### POST `/backups`

Initiates a new backup.

**Request:**

```json
{
  "backup_type": "FULL"
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "status": "Backup initiated",
  "backup_id": "backup_124"
}
```

### 9. `/alerts`

Set or view alerts based on certain metrics thresholds.

#### GET `/alerts`

Lists all the configured alerts.

**Response:**

```json
[
  {
    "alert_id": "alert_001",
    "metric": "cpu_usage",
    "threshold": "90%",
    "action": "email_notify"
  },
  // Additional alerts...
]
```

#### POST `/alerts`

Create a new alert.

**Request:**

```json
{
  "metric": "memory_usage",
  "threshold": "80%",
  "action": "sms_notify"
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "status": "Alert created",
  "alert_id": "alert_002"
}
```

## Example Client-Side Usage

### Python Client Example

A Python script to fetch the current CPU usage:

```python
import requests

def get_cpu_usage(api_url, token):
    headers = {'Authorization': f'Bearer {token}'}
    response = requests.get(f"{api_url}/metrics/cpu_usage", headers=headers)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json()["value"]
    else:
        raise Exception("Failed to fetch CPU usage")

api_url = "http://api.example.com"
token = "your-api-token"
cpu_usage = get_cpu_usage(api_url, token)
print(f"Current CPU Usage: {cpu_usage}")
```

### Alert Configuration Example

Using a simple REST client to configure an alert:

```bash
curl -X POST http://api.example.com/alerts \
     -H 'Authorization: Bearer your-api-token' \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{"metric": "memory_usage", "threshold": "80%", "action": "email_notify"}'
```

## Security Considerations

- **Authentication**: Implement token-based authentication. Each request must include a token in the `Authorization` header.
- **SSL/TLS**: All communication with the API should be encrypted using SSL/TLS.
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.
- **Access Control - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Define roles and permissions to control access to various metrics and endpoints.
- **Audit Logs**: Maintain audit logs of all API interactions for security and compliance purposes.

## Scalability and Performance

- **Caching**: Implement caching for frequently accessed data to reduce load on the server.
- **Load Balancing**: Support load balancing for the API to handle high traffic gracefully.

## Data Format and Standards

- **JSON Format**: All responses are in JSON format for easy parsing and integration.
- **HTTP Status Codes**: Use appropriate HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of requests.
- **Versioning**: The API should be versioned to allow backward compatibility.

## Integration with Monitoring Tools

<!-- - The API should be easily integrable with popular monitoring and alerting tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or Nagios. -->
- Endpoints should provide metrics in a format that these tools can consume without requiring extensive transformation.

## Conclusion

This Metrics API design offers a rich, RESTful interface for accessing a wide range of metrics and system information from the database server. It's designed with security, ease of use, and integration in mind, making it a valuable tool for administrators and developers alike to monitor and understand the performance and health of the database system. It incorporates popular features from Kubernetes and Firecracker MicroVMs, offering a range of capabilities from basic metrics collection to advanced configurations and real-time event streaming. This API design caters to the needs of modern applications, providing the tools necessary for effective database management and monitoring.
